### Week 2 project overview
This project is developed as part of BrainHack School 2025 in Montreal. The Week 2 project overview slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BFQEd32ZGSvIpQaBQh5KjRjrZ0RL78illSvqR80Dr_E/edit?usp=sharing).

## üìö Background 
The reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging has affected many research domains, and psychiatric research is no exception <sup>[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2022.12.006)</sup>. To address this issue, initiatives such as the ENIGMA consortium (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analyses) were launched <sup>[2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-013-9269-5)</sup>. ENIGMA is a consortium comprising numerous research sites and organized into several Disease Working Groups that focus on most major psychiatric conditions. 

This approach has proven successful for structural and diffusion MRI, thanks to the development of open and reproducible protocols (https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/). In this context, Waller et al., 2020 developed HALFpipe <sup>[3](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25829)</sup>, an open-source software that facilitates the preprocessing and extraction of connectivity matrices from functional MRI data. However, no standard tools has yet been proposed by ENIGMA for statistical analyses of functional connectivity matrices.

## üéØ Objectives
### Main objectives
This project aims to support the broader collaborative effort by developing a dedicated library for conducting Connectome-Wide Association Studies (CWAS) based on connectivity matrices generated by HALFpipe.

### Objectives for BrainHack school
Learn how to : 
1. Write scripts in python following the BIDS-app workflow
2. Build a GitHub repository with automated tests with GitHub Actions
3. Develop a sustainable and easy-to-use python package with uv
4. Produce interactive plots and interactive website ‚ú®
 
## üß∞ Tools 
This project uses the following tools and standards to ensure reproducibility, openness, and long-term usability:
- **Python scripts** : To write functions and be able to test them
- **Git & GitHub**: 
   - Enables version control and promotes open-source, collaborative development of the library.
   - Implements automated testing and continuous integration to maintain code quality during development (Git Actions).
- **BIDS Ecosystem**: Ensures compatibility with the BIDS standard, following the workflow of a BIDS App ([4](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005209)).
- **Python Packaging with uv**: Distributes the tool as an installable open-source Python library for easy integration and reuse.
- **Container (Docker)**: Ensures cross-platform compatibility and promotes reproducible research.
- Interactive documentation : Provides runnable examples directly on the website for users to test and explore.
   - **Jupyter Notebooks**
   - **Plots with Plotly**

## üß† Data 
To test the integration of the code, toy data will be generated.

## üóìÔ∏è Deliverables Week 4
*Code development:*
- Python scripts with functions to perform the CWAS
- A GitHub repository with integration test (GitHub Action)
- A python package ready to be used
- A Container

*Documentation:*
- A Jupyter Notebook with a tutorial
